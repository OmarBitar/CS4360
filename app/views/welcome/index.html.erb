  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>
    The very first thing we recommend is setting up your "Roles".
    Your Roles tell us all of the responsibilities that will need to be covered.
    We can't write any coverage rules without at least one Role.
    <div id=button_to_roles>
      <%= button_to "Take me to Roles!", roles_path, :method => "get" %>
    </div>
  </p>


  <p>
    After your Roles are established, we'll need to know which Roles need to be covered on
    which days and by how many people.  You'll define these needs by creating
    <%= link_to "Coverage Rules", coverage_rules_path %>, so that's the next place we suggest you
    go after you've defined your Roles.
  </p>

  <p>
    When that's done, you can let us know about the <%= link_to "Employees", employees_path %> you have.
    If you've already created your Roles, you will be able to let us know which Roles they're
    able to perform in this same step.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you've let us know your Roles, Coverage Rules, and Employees, the last step is to have us help you
    generate a <%= link_to "Schedule", schedules_path %>.
  </p>

    If you decide you'd like to make changes to your account, you can do so by clicking your username
    or the cogwheel <%= image_tag("icons/cogwheel.png") %> on the header above.

    If you want to read this page again, just click the
    <%= image_tag("icons/circle_question.png") %>
    image in the top-right corner.
