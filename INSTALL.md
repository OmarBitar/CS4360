# Installation
These instructions are designed for setting up Floor Coverage website to run on localhost. 
If you want to deploy the software for your own project, then see how it is implemented to deploy on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) on 
the [production](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360/tree/production) branch.

These instructions are based on Windows 10 and WSL for docker, which what was used by the Floor Coverage team. 

It is important to reiterate that: -
* The [master](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360) branch is for development and the [production](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360/tree/production) is for publishing to `Heroku`
* The [master](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360) branch uses `Sqlite3` and [production](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360/tree/production) branch  uses `PostgreSQL`
