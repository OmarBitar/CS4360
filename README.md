# Explanation of this repository, and how it functions.

* The web site is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) with a [Postgres Service](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) provided by `Heroku`
* In order the host the web site on `Heroku`, the code base must be [containerized with docker](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails6). 
All of that work is done in [production](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360/tree/production).
* The [master](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360) branch is for development and the [production](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360/tree/production) branch is for publishing to `Heroku`
* The [master](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360) branch uses `Sqlite3` and [production](https://github.com/nweicker/CS4360/tree/production) branch  uses `PostgreSQL`
